## Project's aim
As I work towards becoming a professional Web Developer, I wanted to create an online Portfolio that showcases applications I have worked on up to now. I will continue to add to my Portfolio in my future as there will always be something new to learn.

This is important as I begin to apply for a permanent career in Web Development. Future employers will need to see the skills I have and how I apply the knowledge I gained in the UW Bootcamp and on my own. 

## Usage
1. When visiting the Portfolio you will see my image, future career title, and a nav bar at the top. 
2. Clicking the "House" icon will connect the user to the Home page.
3. Clicking the "Torso shape with a ?" icon will connect the user to the About page.
4. Clicking the "Lightbulb" icon will connect the user to the Projects Page.
5. Clicking the "Sheet of paper with a magnifying glass" icon will connect the user to a separate tab that will display a pdf of my Resume.
6. Clicking the "Notebook with a torso" icon will connect the user to the Contact Page.
7. When visiting the Projects Page, the user can click on an image to be connected to the deployed app or repository(if it is only a Back-End App). Clicking the text "Github Repository" will take the user to the repository for that specific App.
8. When visiting the Contact Page, the user can click "Send E-mail" to be directed to choose which medium they will use to E-mail me. Clicking "GitHub" text will connect the user to my GitHub Profile. Clicking "LinkedIn" text will connect the user to my LinkedIn Profile.
